# Articles

A collection of articles I like. This is rather short because, while I have
a massive [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) archive, up until now I never bothered to safe the good ones.


## Software

- [Why Doctors Hate Their Computers](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/why-doctors-hate-their-computers)
    
    How software designed with an infinite amount of requirements is preventing doctor's from interacting with patients and forces them to focus on their computers. I especially liked how the author wrote about mutation and selection.
    > Adaptation requires two things: mutation and selection. Mutation produces variety and deviation; selection kills off the least functional mutations. Our old, craft-based, pre-computer system of professional practiceâ€”in medicine and in other fieldsâ€”was all mutation and no selection. There was plenty of room for individuals to do things differently from the norm; everyone could be an innovator. But there was no real mechanism for weeding out bad ideas or practices.
    >
    > Computerization, by contrast, is all selection and no mutation. Leaders install a monolith, and the smallest changes require a committee decision, plus weeks of testing and debugging to make sure that fixing the daylight-saving-time problem, say, doesnâ€™t wreck some other, distant part of the system.
    
    There is also a great daylights savings time story in there; just another reason to get rid of it:
    
    > Last fall, the night before daylight-saving time ended, an all-user e-mail alert went out. The system did not have a way to record information when the hour from 1 a.m. to 1:59 a.m. repeated in the night. This was, for the system, a surprise event. The only solution was to shut down the lab systems during the repeated hour. Data from integrated biomedical devices (such as monitoring equipment for patientsâ€™ vital signs) would be unavailable and would have to be recorded by hand. Fetal monitors in the obstetrics unit would have to be manually switched off and on at the top of the repeated hour.
